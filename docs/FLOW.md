---

## 👤 Guest Flow (Customer Journey)

- Update room status → **Cleaning**

---

## 🧹 Housekeeping Flow

**Task Assignment**

- System notifies housekeeping on guest check‑out

**Room Status Updates**

- **Cleaning → Available** when ready
- Mark **Maintenance Needed** if issues are found

**Guest Requests**

- Deliver amenities (towels, linens, toiletries)
- Log request completion in the system

---

## 🛠️ Admin Flow

**System Configuration**

- Define room types, pricing, promotions
- Manage seasonal rates & discounts

**User & Role Management**

- Add/update staff accounts (FO, housekeeping)

**Operations Oversight**

- Monitor bookings, occupancy, and revenue
- Approve/reject cancellations or escalations

**Reports & Analytics**

- Occupancy, revenue trends, housekeeping performance
- Guest history & preferences

---

## 🔄 System Status Lifecycle

- **Room:** Available → Reserved → Occupied → Cleaning → Available
- **Special States:** Maintenance, Out of Service

---

## 📊 End-to-End Flow Summary

1. Guest searches & books
2. FO verifies booking & assigns room
3. Guest checks in → room status = **Occupied**
4. During stay → requests handled by FO & housekeeping
5. Guest checks out → FO updates room status = **Cleaning**
6. Housekeeping cleans → updates to **Available**
7. Admin monitors → analytics & reports

---

## 🔧 Extended: With Inventory

### 👤 Guest Flow (with Inventory Interactions)

**Search & Booking**

- Browse rooms/suites; select dates → confirm booking → receive booking ID

**Check‑in**

- FO validates booking → assigns room → issues key

**During Stay**

- Requests (extra pillow, toiletries, food/drinks)
- Minibar consumption is tracked to inventory

**Check‑out**

- FO finalizes bill (room + minibar + services)
- Guest pays → receipt issued

### 🧑‍💼 Front Office (FO) Flow — Inventory Touchpoints

**Booking & Reservation**

- Manage walk‑in/online bookings
- Assign room → mark **Reserved/Occupied**

**Check‑in/Check‑out**

- Manage guest profiles
- Update billing (room + inventory usage)

**Service Requests**

- Log guest requests → trigger housekeeping/inventory updates

**Inventory Tracking (via requests)**

- Example: guest requests towel → FO logs → housekeeping delivers → **inventory decreases**

### 🧹 Housekeeping Flow — Inventory Touchpoints

**Room Status**

- Update **Cleaning → Available**

**Guest Requests**

- Deliver items (linens, toiletries, water)
- Log usage → deducted from inventory

**Cleaning Supplies**

- Request restock (detergent, soap, etc.)

**Maintenance Flag**

- Mark **Maintenance Needed** if issues found

### 🛠️ Admin Flow — Inventory Oversight

- Configure room types, rates, amenities
- Manage roles: FO, housekeeping, inventory staff
- Monitor bookings, occupancy, revenue
- **Inventory Oversight:** track usage (toiletries, linens, food/drink stock), generate low‑stock alerts, approve purchase orders
- **Reports & Analytics:** occupancy rate, sales trends, housekeeping performance, inventory (consumption, wastage)

### 📦 Inventory Flow

**Stock‑In (Procurement)**

- Supplier delivers → Admin/Inventory staff logs items
- Categories: linens, toiletries, minibar items, cleaning supplies

**Stock Allocation**

- Housekeeping takes supplies for cleaning
- FO approves guest‑requested items (towels, shampoo, water)
- Minibar restocked

**Stock‑Out (Usage)**

- When items are used → deducted from inventory

**Monitoring & Alerts**

- System tracks stock levels → auto‑alert for low stock

**Reporting**

- Daily/Monthly consumption reports
- Cost tracking & budget planning

### 🔄 Unified Status + Inventory Lifecycles

- **Room:** Available → Reserved → Occupied → Cleaning → Available
- **Inventory:** In Stock → Allocated → Consumed → Restocked

### 📊 End-to-End Example (with Inventory)

1. Guest books → FO assigns room
2. Guest requests extra towel → FO logs → Housekeeping delivers → **Inventory auto‑deducted**
3. Guest consumes minibar → **Inventory auto‑deducted**
4. Check‑out → FO finalizes bill (room + minibar + extras)
5. Housekeeping cleans → consumes supplies → room → **Available**
6. Admin reviews revenue + inventory usage reports

## ✅ Notes

- Keep **status transitions** authoritative; drive UI badges and automation from these.
- Log **every inventory movement** (stock-in, allocation, consumption) for auditability.
- Route **guest requests** through FO for visibility, even when self‑service is available.
